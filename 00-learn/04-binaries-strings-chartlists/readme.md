### BINARIES, STRINGS AND CHARLISTS

> These are well explained in the [docs]https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/binaries-strings-and-char-lists.html#unicode-and-code-points()

```exs

 string = "héllo"

 IO.puts "the length of the string: #{String.length(string)}"

 IO.puts "the number of the characters in the string: #{length(String.to_charlist(string))}"

```
